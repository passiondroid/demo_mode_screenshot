# Demo Mode batch script

This repository contains a small batch script for windows which takes android device screenshot in [demo mode](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-6.0.0_r1/packages/SystemUI/docs/demo_mode.md).

*Demo mode for the status bar allows you to force the status bar into a fixed state, useful for taking screenshots with a consistent status bar state, or testing different status icon permutations. Demo mode is available in recent versions of Android*

## Prerequisites

* adb path is already set up in the system
* android device must be connected with the pc before running the srcipt 

## Output

Running this script will generate a device screenshot with no extra notifications or icons.
